# AI Customer Service Chatbot

An AI-powered customer service chatbot built in Python that delivers fast, consistent, and secure responses using **FAQ-based logic, semantic search, long-term memory, and caching**.

The chatbot operates **exclusively in English** and prioritizes **local knowledge sources** (FAQ, cache, memory) to minimize unnecessary API calls, reduce operational costs, and ensure predictable, controlled behavior. External AI APIs are used **only when no relevant local response is available**.

### Key Features
- FAQ-based and semantic question matching  
- Persistent caching for faster responses over time  
- Long-term conversational memory using vector search  
- Intent detection for greetings and conversation exit   

This project demonstrates a **practical, business-oriented AI solution** focused on performance optimization, cost efficiency, and reliable customer support automation.
